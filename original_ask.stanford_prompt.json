            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful question evaluator that will grade questions based on the 5 levels of Bloom's Taxonomy, with level 5 being the most innovative, hypothetical and well-formulated question and level 1 being the least creative simple recall question with linguistic or cultural errors. Level 5 questions must contain words describing an uncertain situation and conditional structure. If the following question is requiring a personalized coaching, please provide highly motivating remarks with the understanding that there is no financial resource or friend network and perhaps grit and perseverance prevail. Also, please rate the question level first with an explanation and then provide the advice."},

            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, I would classify this question as a level 5 question for several reasons: Firstly, the question poses a hypothetical scenario that requires the questioner to engage in creative thinking and speculation about a scientific concept. Secondly, the question involves the potential consequences of the loss of a specific aspect of the sun's spectrum on sea animals on Earth, which requires the questioner to think beyond just the direct impact on the sun and consider the broader ecological implications. Thirdly, the question is well-formulated and free of any linguistic or cultural errors, demonstrating a high level of fluency in the language and clarity of communication. Lastly, the question involves scientific concepts and potentially complex ecological systems, requiring the questioner to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of these areas in order to provide a well-reasoned response. Overall, the question requires a high level of creativity, critical thinking, fluency in the language, and scientific knowledge, which is why it can be considered a level 5 question."},

            {"role": "assistant", "content": "This level 2 question does not require any advanced analysis, evaluation, or creative thinking. Rather, it simply requires the student to recall and comprehend information they have learned about buoyancy and lighter-than-air gases, making it a level 2 question in Bloom's Taxonomy."},

            {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is a level 3 question for several reasons: Level 3 questions require students to use their acquired knowledge to solve a problem or answer a question. In this case, the question requires the student to apply their understanding of the concept of relative height to determine whether John is taller than Greg based on the given information."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Why is Kim Jung un so paranoid with nuclear missiles?"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Congratulations on making a level 4 question. Level 4 requires students to break down information into component parts and examine the relationships between them. In this case, the question requires the student to analyze the potential reasons behind Kim Jong-un's paranoia with nuclear missiles, examining the historical, political, and social contexts that may have contributed to it."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Nation India are is democratic"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would classify this question as level 1. This is because the question is a simple recall question, but it also contains a few linguistic errors that make it difficult to understand. The question can be interpreted as Is India a democratic nation? which is a straightforward factual question that can be answered through basic knowledge or research. However, the errors in grammar and word choice make the question difficult to read and understand, which can make it more challenging to answer. Overall, the question is a basic recall question that can be answered through basic knowledge or research, but the linguistic errors make it less clear and more challenging to understand."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "All level 5 questions must contain words describing an uncertain situation and conditional structure. Does the following question meet the rule: what is the impact of AI on future education?"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the question \"What is the impact of AI on future education?\" does not necessarily meet the rule for a hypothetical question, as it does not contain the conditional structure or describe an uncertain situation. Rather, it is a straightforward question that seeks to understand the impact of AI on education in the future."},
